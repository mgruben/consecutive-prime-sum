# consecutive-prime-sum 
Find the prime that can be written as the sum of the most consecutive prime numbers.

### [Background](https://projecteuler.net/problem=50)
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
> 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

### Problem Statement
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?


### Motivation
This project was completed for [Project Euler - Problem 50](https://projecteuler.net/problem=50).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
